## 10. Recommended First Implementation Slice

Implement only these tasks first:

1. T0.1 Create Workspace
2. T0.2 Configure TypeScript And Tests
3. T1.1 Define Annotation Schema
4. T1.2 Parse Plain Lyrics
5. T1.4 Generate Baseline Annotation JSON
6. T4.1 Implement `annotate` with placeholder generated fields

This slice proves the project shape and CLI flow before any difficult Japanese conversion logic is added.

## 11. Definition Of Done For Each Task

Each task is done only when:

- The behavior is implemented.
- Tests or explicit verification commands exist.
- Error cases are handled where listed.
- No unrelated refactors are included.
- Documentation is updated if the data shape or command behavior changes.

## 12. Current Progress Log

### Completed In Current Implementation

- T0.1 workspace setup:
  - Added pnpm workspace, root package scripts, TypeScript base config, and `.gitignore`.
  - Created `packages/core` and `packages/cli`.
- T0.2 TypeScript and tests:
  - Added Vitest test coverage across core and CLI.
- T1.1 annotation schema:
  - Added TypeScript model types and runtime validation.
  - Validation now reports path-level errors for malformed lines, notes, and manual overrides.
- T1.2/T1.3 input parsing:
  - Plain text parsing works.
  - Simple LRC timestamps are preserved.
  - UTF-8 BOM is stripped.
  - Trailing newline no longer creates an extra lyric line.
- T1.4 baseline annotation:
  - Generates project JSON with line IDs, source metadata, review flags, generated layers, and manual override slots.
- T2.1 Japanese reading adapter:
  - Added offline `kuromoji` reading adapter.
  - Kanji-containing lines can now produce kana, romaji, Chinese pronunciation aid, and notes.
  - Kanji lines still retain `unknown_kanji_reading` for review.
- T2.2/T2.3 kana and romaji:
  - Katakana to hiragana normalization.
  - Kana-to-romaji for common kana, sokuon, youon, long vowels, `ん`, common foreign-sound katakana combinations, and `を -> wo`.
  - Reading-adapter romaji now includes word spacing when available.
- T3.1/T3.2/T3.3 pronunciation aid and difficulty notes:
  - Generates `中文发音辅助`.
  - Detects long vowels, small `っ`, youon, `ん`, `つ`, `ふ`, `し/ち/じ`, ra-row, voiced/semi-voiced sounds.
  - Deduplicates repeated same-message reminders in a line.
  - Preserves parenthesized Latin ad-libs such as `(Oh)`.
- T4 CLI:
  - `annotate`, `validate`, and `export` are implemented.
  - Export formats: Markdown, JSON, text.
  - CLI preserves non-Japanese lines for export.
- T5 manual corrections:
  - Manual overrides are validated.
  - Export uses manual overrides.
  - If only manual kana is provided, romaji, Chinese pronunciation aid, and notes are derived from that kana.
- T6 sample validation:
  - Added a synthetic fixture set.
  - Tested user-provided short lyric snippets.
  - Added sample-driven reading overrides for known lyric readings.

### Current Verification Commands

The following commands pass:

```text
corepack pnpm test
corepack pnpm typecheck
corepack pnpm build
```

Current tests cover core parsing, schema validation, kana-to-romaji, reading adapter, Chinese pronunciation aid, difficulty detection, exports, CLI success/failure paths, manual corrections, UTF-8 BOM handling, and sample validation.

### Sample Findings

User-provided snippets exposed these important behaviors:

- Dictionary readings work for many ordinary kanji phrases:
  - `どうでもいいような 夜だけど` -> `dou demo ii you na yoru dakedo`
  - `まだ止まった 刻む針も` -> `mada tomatta kizamu hari mo`
  - `入り浸った 散らかる部屋も` -> `iribitatta chirakaru heya mo`
- Lyrics can use special readings that differ from dictionary output:
  - `響めき` should be treated as `どよめき` in the tested lyric.
  - `心魅かれてく` should be treated as `こころひかれてく`.
  - `景色` was reference-romaji aligned to `ばしょ` in the tested lyric.
- A non-Japanese user cannot reliably know whether generated kana is wrong. Manual kana editing is useful but not sufficient as the primary validation flow.

### Current Known Problems

- The small reading override list is hard-coded in `readingAdapter.ts`; this should not become the long-term mechanism.
- The product needs reference-romaji comparison so users can paste romaji found online and see whether generated output disagrees.
- Romaji spacing is currently heuristic and sample-driven.
- The current system does not infer timing from audio; all rhythm hints remain text-based.
- WebUI has not started.

### Recommended Next Slice

Implement local reference-romaji comparison before WebUI:

1. Accept Japanese lyric lines plus optional reference romaji lines.
2. Generate system romaji with the current adapter.
3. Normalize case, punctuation, apostrophes, and spacing.
4. Report:
   - exact match,
   - spacing/case-only difference,
   - reading mismatch.
5. Produce a Markdown comparison report.

This is the best next step because the target user may not know Japanese, but can often find romaji online.
